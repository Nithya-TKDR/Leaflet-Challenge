# Leaflet-Challenge
---
**Brief Description**: This challenge comprises of two separate tasks to visualize USGS (United States Geological Survey) data on earthquakes to better educate and inform government agencies worldwide and the public:
> - *Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization* - Import and visualize the sample data that plots all earthquakes based on their longitude and latitude using Leaflet.
> - *Part 2: Gather and Plot More Data* - This is **optional** and is not developed for this project.<br>

**Inputs**: The challenge takes in as input one of the many sample datasets that the [USGS GeoJson Page](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) provides. This is intended to be used as a programatic interface for applications.<br>

**Outputs**: The challenge provides the following outputs as described below:
> - *Earthquake Plot Map*: Using Leaflet, a map that plots all the earthquakes from the sample dataset based on their longitude and latitude.    
> - *Plot Legend*: A legend that provides more context on the above data including the depth and the corresponding color. 
> - *Popups*: Popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.<br>
